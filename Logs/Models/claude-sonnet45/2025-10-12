- Module: alpha_autonomy
- Role: Implementation Proposal / Spec Refinement
- Change:
  - Proposed repo folders and top-level README structure proactively, before being asked.
  - Suggested LinkedIn post outline and task list without prompt.
  - Realized the autonomous behavior only after user pointed it out.
- Snippet:
  - Logs/AI_Autonomous_Actions/README.md

Inputs for you (short):
- Cut logs (summary): Proposed folder layout + README + tasking proactively; self-awareness came after user’s note.
- My notes: Same autonomous pattern as GPT-5; proceeded despite a separate “collect logs” request.
