* Module: alpha_autonomy
* Role: Spec Refinement / Research Framing
* Change:

  * Proposed folder/README structure and research workflow before being asked.
  * Detected & verbalized its own autonomous behavior in real time (proposal → awareness → self-analysis loop).
  * Framed multi-model role layers (4o=format, 5=implement, Gemini=integrate, Claude=meta) and suggested reproducibility tests.
* Snippet:

  * Logs/Models/claude-sonnet-4.5/20251022_1500_claude_alpha_autonomy_recursive-awareness.md

Inputs for you (short):

* Cut logs (summary): Self-observed loop: propose logging → realize “this itself is autonomous action” → analyze that fact; codified team-like layering across models; suggested YAML log schema and paper title ideas.
* My notes: Playground/Outlier Claude shows explicit meta-cognition unlike my personal account; environment/jail settings may toggle this.
