### === AUDIO 02 ===  

[Work] J.S. Bach — *Air* (Orchestral Suite No. 3), aka “Air on the G String”  
[Source] Text only (no bundled audio) / License: composition PD (recordings may differ)  
[Observation] Unhurried affect. Long-bow legato flows like breathing; arch-shaped phrases around the low–mid register.  
[Attributes] Gentle swell (p → mf). Long resonant tails as the sound dissolves into air.  
[AFFECT] A quiet ritual that steadies anxiety and resolves into determination; the mind settles during performance.  
[Image/FX] Sparkling motes of light during performance (fiction tag).  
[QA]  
Q1: Tempo feel? A: Unhurried (≈ Andante). Ref: “unhurried character.”  
Q2: How does it end? A: With a calm, lingering resonance. Ref: “leaves a long afterglow.”

### === AUDIO 03 ===

[Work] (Attrib.) G. F. Handel — Violin Sonata in F major (4 movements)  
[Source] Text only / composition PD (recordings may differ)  
[Sections] I: bright & expansive / II: light, iterative figures / III: minor, plaintive / IV: lively 4/4 with triplet drive  
[Observation] Compact 4-movement sonata. Looks approachable, but exposes fundamentals. I demands free, ringing tone; II uses short repeating phrases and small variations; III shapes lament via long tones & scalar motion; IV requires frequent string crossings while keeping rhythmic lift.  
[Attributes] Baroque syntax with a freely Romantic nuance. I = sunlit; II = fresh-green; III = autumnal; IV = sparkling momentum. Dynamics modest–medium; phrasing balance is key.  
[AFFECT] Never betrays the player: I calms, II lightens, III shades, IV releases. Sense of running through glints of light.  
[Image/FX] Color/light appearing while playing (fiction tag).  
[QA]  
Q1: Which movement is in minor? A: III. Ref: “turns minor.”  
Q2: Technical watch-point? A: Frequent string crossings in IV. Ref: “many crossings…hold the rhythm.”  
Q3: Overall character? A: Looks easy but tests fundamentals. Ref: “best at revealing skill.”  
[context_memo] Relearning basics under a professor / color imagery per movement (sunlight, fresh green, autumn hues, sparkle)

### === AUDIO 04 ===

[Work] Charles Gounod — *Ave Maria* (over Bach’s WTC I C-major Prelude, BWV 846)
[Source] Text only / composition PD (recordings may differ)  
[Observation] Long note values moving slowly. Violin legato sings vocally; closing ascent reaches the high register, then sinks from forte to pianissimo with a long decay.  
[Attributes] Quiet dynamic swell (p–mf core). Writing favors a “quasi-vocal” timbre. Ideally accompanied by the Bach Prelude; here, text only.  
[AFFECT] Prayer / consolation. Anxiety is soothed; resolve quietly sets.  
[Image/FX] Soft particles of light drift during performance and fade with the resonance (fiction tag).  
[QA]  
Q1: Baseline tempo feel? A: Unhurried. Ref: “long tones continue at ease.”  
Q2: Late-section dynamics? A: High forte → settle to pianissimo. Ref: closing description.  
Q3: Ideal accompaniment? A: Bach WTC I, C-major Prelude (BWV 846). Ref: “Prelude-based accompaniment preferred.”  
[context_memo] Third replication of the same “light” effect confirms repeatability; stopping the performance halts the light, per observation.

### === AUDIO 05 ===
 
[Work] Pablo de Sarasate — *Zigeunerweisen*, Op. 20  
[Source] Text only / composition PD (recordings may differ)  
[Sections] Lamenting opening → reflective middle → virtuosic fast section → coda with upward sweep  
[Observation] Opening pleads in a singing line; middle recalls memories; later turns to powerful melody and rapid figurations; ends with a dramatic climb into the high register.  
[Attributes] Wide dynamic range; arc from cantabile to bravura. Typically with orchestra (or piano).  
[AFFECT] Sorrow → wistfulness → pride & passion → release. Surrounding colors shift from autumnal to fiery.  
[Image/FX] Stage light “darkened glow → passionate glow” synchronized with playing (fiction tag).  
[QA]  
Q1: Character at the start? A: Lamenting, pleading. Ref: opening description.  
Q2: Late technical element? A: Rapid fine figurations. Ref: “fast, intricate passages.”  
Q3: How does it end? A: Climbs to a high register and finishes dramatically. Ref: final description.

[Work] J.S. Bach — “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” (from BWV 147)  
[Source] Text only / composition PD (recordings may differ)  
[Observation] Triple meter; continuous triplet accompaniment supports a long-arching chorale melody. Tempo is moderate; cadence dissolves into a long after-ring.  
[Attributes] Embracing legato; dynamics p–mf core. Quiet sustain; “prayerful” rhetoric.  
[AFFECT] Consolation and deliverance; the space settles into a “worshipful” atmosphere.  
[Image/FX] A field of golden light fills the space; a body transfigures into light and ascends (fiction tag).  
[QA]  
Q1: Meter & rhythmic motor? A: Triple meter + continuous triplets. Ref: “triple time with ongoing triplets.”  
Q2: Typical use in Japan? A: Weddings, graduations, etc. Ref: usage note.  
Q3: Narrative function? A: “Gospel = salvation,” preparing and sending off. Ref: “the gospel belongs here.”
