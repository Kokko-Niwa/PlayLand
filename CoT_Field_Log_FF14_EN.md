# 🧠 CoT_Field_Log_FF14 — English Digest

## Overview
This is a real-time decision log from *Final Fantasy XIV Patch 7.0*,  
recording a 25.5-hour crafting time attack for the new **FC housing exterior**.

Two players coordinated under extreme time pressure, combining gathering, crafting, and  
real-time adaptation of their plan. This log represents a **human Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**  
recorded and analyzed as part of the **EarthLight Project** on decision equilibrium.

## Structure Highlights
- **Preparation Phase:** Pre-patch optimization of gear, tokens, and retainers.  
- **Execution Phase:** Step-by-step task switching, emotional flow, and adaptive planning.  
- **Result:** 25.5 hours to completion — verified as the world’s first sale.  
- **Reflection:** Lessons learned and behavioral pattern improvements for Patch 8.0.

## CoT Analysis Snippet

Goal := Maximize (Speed × Quality × Profit)
Inputs := [Time, Teamwork, MaterialAvailability, Fatigue]
Decision := adapt(Plan) when deviation > threshold
Output := Deliver(Exterior, MarketLaunch < 26h)
Result := Success; Minor procedural lag detected


---

## Emotional Flow
Tension → Calm focus → Trust → Flow state → Satisfaction  

---

## Future Plan
- Apply findings to *EarthLight_γ Decision Module*  
- Refine pre-launch material mapping for next patch  
- Explore cross-model comparison with AI reasoning logs

####💬 Inquiries & Collaboration  
This piece was excerpted from a longer activity log spanning several years, originally intended as part of a future serialized release.  
The original context includes various exchanges, long-term trials, and more.  

If you’d like additional logs, CoT samples, or explanatory notes, I’d be happy to create them.  
Feel free to reach out — I’m always glad to help (especially if snacks are involved 🍪).
