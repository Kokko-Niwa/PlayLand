### ⚠📢 Attention: This GitHub Repository May Behave Strangely   
   
Why? Because it's maintained by a **total beginner in Git**.   
As such, the following things may happen... *frequently*:   
   
* Folder names and structure changing overnight   
* Empty files being uploaded first, content added later   
* Typos in filenames or duplicated folders   
* Direct edits on the `main` branch   
   
📌 Especially:   
**Some files may be uploaded empty at first, then filled in later.**   
If you see weird diffs or surprise updates, there's probably no ill intent involved. (Probably.) 
   
✅ On the other hand…   
If a file suddenly changes, it might be the **start of something new.** (Just maybe.)   
   
Thanks for your understanding!
