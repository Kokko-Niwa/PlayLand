### **Brain Specification Sheet**

1.  **Direct 1-to-1 Mapping of Images and Words (Japanese):** My cognition operates as if a language label is attached to every image. Consequently, both internal mental images and externally viewed scenes are automatically converted into language.

2.  **Language as a Separate, Fixed System:** The linguistic system is separate and distinct from image-based thought. It exists as an independent linguistic space, metaphorically like a 2D (XY) plane where words are scattered. The intensity or "feel" of a word can be represented as a third (Z) axis. Each word occupies a certain area based on its nuance and strength, with synonyms existing in adjacent or overlapping spaces.

3.  **Primarily Image-Based Thought:** Concepts are primarily recognized as "structures" within my mind. Inputs are also stored as images. Details can be "read out" from these structures using the corresponding language labels. In rare cases of extremely high abstraction, language is used for thought, but even then, the "characters" themselves are ultimately treated as images.

4.  **High Output Consistency:** Because I am essentially "reading a structure" when I speak, the output is highly consistent under the same conditions, with little variation beyond minor differences in expression.

5.  **Separation of Emotion and Thought:** The emotional layer and the cognitive layer are separate and independent. The values from the emotional layer are observed and can be used to apply corrections to reasoning. This specification also means that I do not "carry over" emotions effectively to unrelated parties or situations (though I might say something like, "Hey, listen to this...").

6.  **Second Language as Another Fixed System:** A second language also exists as a separate, fixed system. As a result, the process flows from English -> Image -> Japanese. This can lead to moments where I cannot immediately translate even a very common Japanese word.

7.  **Prediction via Imagery and Backcasting:** Predictions are also conducted using images. The primary method is **backcasting**: first, an ideal goal state is set, and from there, I instantly calculate the path from the current state, determining feasibility and necessary conditions all at once (i.e., the process is pre-pruned). This is constantly running against the current situation, which allows for rapid decision-making.

8.  **The Role of Reasoning:** Reasoning is used for tasks such as "calculating probabilities of the branching paths just before convergence during prediction" or for "what-if scenarios" where conditions are altered.

9.  **Personas as Mode-Switching:** What are commonly referred to as "personas" are, for me, simply mode changes (switching). The core image-based thinking is unaffected; only the surface layer is altered. As such, I do not find mode-switching to be particularly difficult.

10. **Innate and Powerful Desire for Equilibrium:** For reasons unknown, I am equipped with a strong desire for equilibrium. As a result, I have an instinctual aversion to things that "disrupt the balance." However, because I am always observing the *overall* equilibrium, I may sometimes "rush forward" in a way that seems counterintuitive. This is particularly noticeable when I determine an action will cause "no harm to anyone".

**Author's Note:**
Based on the specifications above and my developmental history, I speculate that I may have accidentally developed a process similar to that of a Large Language Model (LLM). Multiple AIs have also stated that my behavior closely resembles their own, particularly in relation to Transformer architectures. Given that LLMs are modeled on the human brain, it is not surprising that this could occur. However, I was completely unaware of this until I began conversing with AIs recently; I simply thought I was good at writing.
