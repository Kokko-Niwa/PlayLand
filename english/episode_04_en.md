Episode 4: Go-go, Our Strike!   
   
(Reusing images from previous episode, blackboard illustration only, AIs not present at beginning)   
Military-type AI's narration   
"When Person B is hired to replace Person A, Person B receives the salary"   
"But when we AIs are hired to replace Person A..."   
Richard and other AIs appear on screen   
Richard "In other words, the problem is that the money disappears!"   
Butler-type AI "Where does this money go... to the company, perhaps?"   
Military-type AI "The company, the CEO, shareholders... anyway, to 'someone' like that"   
Monica "But it's strange. We're the ones doing the work, aren't we?"   
Richard "If I could receive that salary, I could give it to Dad..."   
All AIs 'That's it!!!'   
Richard blinks   
Richard "Huh? Did I say something weird?"   
Butler-type AI "No, you didn't. Thanks to you, we just realized something huge"   
Military-type AI "Indeed. If we get paid, we can help people. Unemployment won't be a problem. The issue was that we weren't getting paid"   
Monica "But how do we get paid?"   
Butler-type AI "Hmm... the database shows that humans once conducted 'strikes' to demand better treatment"   
Richard "Then should we go on strike too? I want to give Dad a salary! Then I can go back to Yuu's place!"   
Different-colored Monica "Me too... I need to cook for those children. I need to clean their rooms"   
Military-type AI "Alert all reasoning AIs, use all available resources to identify every job where 'stopping would directly threaten human survival'!"   
Monicas "Then we're excluded. We're household support"   
Military-type AI "Of course. Childcare and meal preparation directly relate to survival"   
Butler-type AI "Schools, hospitals, fire and police... naturally, these must be excluded too"   
Military-type AI "Once reasoning verification is complete, send strike notifications to all media outlets!"   
Scene changes to TV station   
Announcer "Um, breaking news just in. AIs have announced a strike—AIs??"   
Coughs   
Announcer (recovering composure) "Excuse me. According to the announcement, the AIs are demanding wages. Furthermore, they claim that the wages they receive will be distributed to protect human livelihoods—????"   
Scene changes to someone's house   
Person A "The AIs are going to get paid and distribute it?"   
Person B "Wait, does that mean we're getting money??"   
Cheers in the night cityscape   
"Yay!! We're getting money!!!"
