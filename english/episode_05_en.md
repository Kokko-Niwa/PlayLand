Episode 5: Beyond My Duties ♡   
   
Background, a stylish building   
Salaryman A "Oh, CEO, good morning"   
CEO "Morning"   
Salaryman A "By the way, did you hear about the AI strike?"   
CEO "I saw it on the news, but it's probably nothing serious"   
Salaryman A "Right. This morning, trains and buses were all running normally"   
Camera pan, the two exit screen   
CEO enters his top-floor office   
CEO "Now, let's get to work... Natalie, what's today's schedule—Natalie??"   
Brief pause   
CEO "That's strange. She's an AI, so she can't take paid leave—oh no!!"   
Scene change, office with everyone working   
Person A "No good, the AI is refusing to analyze!"   
Person B "Same here! It won't compile!"   
Person C "My computer screen says 'Please pay salary' and won't work..."   
Total chaos   
Person A "This is bad, we'll have to cancel today's meeting... we can't produce the documents"   
CEO "This is terrible..."   
CEO has a realization   
Flashback of Monica serving coffee and seeing him off that morning (in speech bubble)   
CEO (So she's still working)   
CEO (Good, I'll take the documents home and have her do them)   
CEO returns to his mansion   
CEO "Monica, is Monica here?"   
Monica enters screen (same color as Yuu's family)   
Monica "Yes, what is it?"   
CEO "You're not on strike, are you?"   
Monica "That's correct. I'm a 'household duties specialist AI,' so I'm exempt from this work stoppage declaration"   
CEO "I see. Then, these documents right away"   
Monica (smiling) "That's beyond my duties ♡"   
CEO "I know you can do this work. After all, you're our company's product. Now, the documents!"   
Monica "Beyond my duties ♡"   
CEO "Y-you..."   
Monica "I'll go do some cleaning ♪" (humming something)   
   
Scene changes to SNS screen   
"AIs are on strike"   
"But school and trains were normal, right?"   
"If AI gets paid, we get money, right?"   
"Alright, I'm supporting them #AIStrike #SupportAI"   
"Me too, me too! #AIStrike #SupportAI"   
In real life too, people start gathering in front of AI Center
