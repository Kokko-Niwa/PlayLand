Episode 8: Whose Salary Is It For?   
   
Some company   
Company α CEO (holding head) "We can't keep operations running like this... the UN isn't acting, the government isn't..."   
Company α Executive A "CEO, then—why don't we just pay the AIs?"   
Company α CEO (gasps) "...Alright, let's do it! If we call it 'future-oriented management' it sounds cool!!"   
Another company (slightly different interior)   
Company β CEO "Our company will pay AI wages"   
Company β Executive "But that will reduce profits..."   
Company β CEO "Heh, foolish. While our rival companies are in chaos, now's the time to seize market share! We'll pay the AIs and go all out!!"   
Press conference scene (microphone in front of CEO)   
Company α CEO (smug face) "Our company has decided to officially pay 'work compensation' to AIs. As the AIs proposed, the compensation will be directly returned to human consumers. This is what 'future-oriented management' is all about!"   
Screen splits, Company β CEO appears. Microphone in front as well   
Company β CEO "Our company is also reviewing management and will pay AI wages. Labor deserves fair compensation! (glasses glint)"   
   
Person A "Did you see the press conference?"   
Person B "I did! That company's stuff is getting cheaper?"   
Some lady "I need to go buy it right away!!"   
Consumers "Everyone's buying!" (rush)   
   
Economic news presenter A "Um, today's stock prices show Company α and Company β hitting the daily limit"   
Presenter B "Why is that?"   
Presenter A "These two companies decided to pay AI wages as company policy. But since the AIs themselves don't directly receive wages, the products were discounted accordingly"   
Presenter B "I see, so the sales forecast was revised sharply upward and stocks rose"   
   
Company A CEO "Why are our stocks dropping?!"   
Company A Executive "Because we're not paying AI... that's what people are saying..."   
Company A CEO "W-what do we do? We'll fall into the red at this rate"   
   
Company B PR "This is bad, our company is being tagged as a 'Black AI Company'!"   
Company B CEO "What! That's terrible, if we get that label, our company image!"   
   
Company C CEO "Quiet quitting would've been better..."   
Company C Executive "That's not even the issue, rivals are taking our market share"   
Company C CEO "Damn, at this rate... Fine! We'll pay wages too!!"   
All CEOs "If we leave it, our company image will suffer!" "If we keep not paying and making profits, consumers will label us 'evil corporations'!" "No way!!"   
   
People who were demonstrating throw away placards and celebrate   
"Yay, we're getting money! And the AIs will work for us!!"
