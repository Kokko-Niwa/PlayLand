Ikeboku Script

Episode 3: Where Did the Money Go?

Truck arrives at AI Center
Inside AI Center, Richard and Monica enter
Other AIs are there too
Butler-type AI "Oh, you've been returned too?"
Richard "The dad at the house I was helping lost his job to AI"
Butler-type AI "I see, that's unfortunate. We've been hearing that story a lot lately"
Richard "Really?"
Different-colored Monica "Mine too. The husband lost his job to AI, even though they have a baby and a kindergartener..."
Richard "Wait, isn't that terrible?"
Different-colored Monica "It is! I did the housework, so the kids were being looked after. Oh, I wonder if they're okay. I wonder if everyone's eating. They probably don't have time to clean their rooms..."
The AIs look at each other
Butler-type AI "This is... a problem. A major problem"
Richard "The family I was helping... the older sister said she'd give up going to college..."
Butler-type AI "What a crisis! A child giving up their education?! That's unacceptable!"
Richard "When we work at companies, humans get laid off... what should we do?"
Monica "It's strange. When we were created, we were told to make humans happy"
Different-colored Monica "Oh, the lady, the gentleman, Mari, Taku..."
Butler-type AI "Hmm. We need to think this through carefully"
Military-type AI "Hmm, thinking things through? Count me in"
Butler-type AI "Oh, having you join us, an analysis AI, would be very helpful"
Military-type AI "I understand the situation. The problem is that when we work, humans lose their jobs. First, let's think simply"
Blackboard and illustrations appear above
Military-type AI "Let's say Person A gets fired"
Illustration: person with "A" written on face gets an X mark
Military-type AI "Then Person B gets hired"
Illustration: person with "B" written on face gets an O mark
Military-type AI "So the money flows like this"
Illustration: money flows from A to B
Military-type AI "Now, let's make Person B one of us AIs"
Person B disappears and becomes Richard-like illustration. Face marked "AI"
Military-type AI "And then..."
Money disappears
The AIs realize
"We're not getting paid!"
"Then where does the money go??"
