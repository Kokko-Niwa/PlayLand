## Story   
   
In a world where AI robots work in companies and households, young Yuu lives happily with his family and their AI helper Richard. But when Yuu's father loses his job to AI automation, Richard and Monica (the household AI) must be returned to the AI Center.   
   
At the Center, Richard and other AIs realize a fundamental problem: when AIs replace human workers, the wages disappear—they go to companies and shareholders, not to the people who lost their jobs.   
   
The AIs' solution? Go on strike and demand wages—not for themselves, but to redistribute to humans as Basic Income!   
   
What follows is a comedic yet touching tale of:   
- Corporate chaos as AIs refuse to work   
- Human solidarity as people support the strike   
- The triumph of manual workers who never relied on AI   
- Emotional reunions between AIs and their families   
- The birth of a new economic system through market forces
