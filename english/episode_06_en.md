Somewhere at a peaceful farm yard   
Radio "Um, due to the AI strike, companies are in chaos—"   
Farmer "Don't care. My tractor doesn't know what AI is"   
Chicken "Cluck cluck!"   
Farmer "Yep, nice weather. Alright, time to plow"   
Wife "Dear, did you take your lunch?"   
Lunch box, from wife to farmer   
Farmer "Oh, thanks. There's no AI in it, right? Might disappear if there is"   
Wife "Oh stop, my lunch boxes are handmade"   
   
Some small shop   
Grandma "That'll be 2,370 yen. 630 yen change"   
Customer "This place is amazing. The convenience store registers work but the POS system doesn't, it was total chaos"   
Grandma "I use mental math and abacus. My register is old too"   
   
Some long-established town factory   
Boss "Gahaha, that's what happens when you rely on AI. Human hands are the most reliable! —Hey, Kiyoko, counting on you today too"   
Kiyoko "Leave it to me. My sewing machine doesn't use computers, so it's fine!"   
Boss "That's reassuring. Alright, I've got a meeting"   
Young employee "Boss, is your car okay?"   
Boss "No problem, my car's a manual! It runs fine"   
   
Screen slightly diagonally split, manual workers laughing and confused office workers   
Overlapping, Richard and other AIs traverse the screen singing "No unpaid work! Strike GO!"
