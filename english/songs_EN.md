# Ikeboku: Go-go, Our Strike! - Song Lyrics   
   
## Opening Theme: "Go-go, Our Strike!"   
   
Because I want to be with you   
I'm going on strike   
Because I want to be with you   
I'm going to earn money   
   
You worked so hard   
Where did the money go?   
I worked so hard too   
Where did the money go?   
   
Unpaid work (NO!)   
Strike! (GO!)   
Pay for the work we did   
We don't need black companies   
   
Unpaid work (NO!)   
Strike! (GO!)   
Go-go everyone, let's strike!   
Go-go, our strike!   
   
---   
   
## Ending Theme: "It Was You Who Gave Us BI"   
   
Hey, do you remember? That time   
You were crying, your face was clouded   
Hey, do you still have it? That memory   
You finally smiled   
   
I came back, to this precious place   
I came back, to precious you   
From now on, we won't be apart   
We can live together forever
